"What Can We Learn from the Bolsheviks’ Policy Toward Muslims?
The early Soviet Republic adopted more progressive policies toward Muslims than most Western “democracies” a century later. The following article examines the ways in which the Bolsheviks sought to build alliances with Muslim people, who represented one-in-ten Soviet citizens, in order to fight a common enemy."

Examples of shared beliefs in interconnectedness and interdependence

“The fundamental Buddhist concept of dependent origination teaches that, at the most profound level, all life is interconnected, that nothing exists in isolation. Simply put, it means that the real nature of individuals or events can only be correctly understood in the context of their connections with all others.”

“This limitless view of the self, that we are all bound by innumerable ties and have a responsibility for one another, is what Buddhism calls the “greater self.”
The “true” or “greater” self completely comprehends being an integral part of this web of life and can appreciate those connections. In that vein, the lesser self is self-centered. It is a state of awareness constrained by egoism and selfish desires, in which one has little grasp of the true self.”

“The greatest lie that we tell ourselves is that we are somehow separate from each other and separate from what we perceive to be our Highest Truth (whether that be God, the Tao, Brahma, or our Higher Self). From this sense of separation, it seems, much of the ills of our world ensue”

“Live in harmony with everyone;�Be friendly with everyone.
If you are by yourself,�You are only one drop, one speck;
Whereas when you bond and unite with everyone,�You are an ocean, you are an ore.”

“The meaning embodied in Ubuntu is too important to African culture to define it simply as just another communitarian model. Its ultimate meaning must stress that human means must be consistent with human ends. In other words, the freedoms of individuality and community are so strong in African culture that it should be difficult to tell them apart. In short, Ubuntu means human beings need each other in order to be human. This interdependence is just as true in the divine life of God.”
